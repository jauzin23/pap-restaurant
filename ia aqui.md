hi, the stock page is all wrongly made, na tabela inicial nao pode/deve ser possivel adicionar nem

remover quantidade, isso apenas pode acontecer  
nas  
 warehouses ok? mete lá os botoes para
adicionar/remover stock nas warehouses, also, say  
im storing coca-cola on warehouse A but not on B  
but i just bought more and want to store it on B,  
u need to allow me to add items to the warehouse,  
but make sure that that item isnt already once in  
that warehouse u feel me? not only that, but when  
adding a new item, remove categoria and Fornecedor  
 from there, and correctly fetch the location,  
considering the api make sure that modal is
correctly sending all the needed information.  
also, the transfer stock modal isnt fetching the  
warehouses. make a plan and execute this
