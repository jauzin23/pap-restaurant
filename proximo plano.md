now i want u to plan how the "payment" page should kind of be. study the way tablelayout works and the order page and etc. i was thinking of sort of a page that also featured change calculations, a calculator itself, one should also be able to edit the pricing of each item and one should be able to select what order items to select to pay from what table all of this in a sort of list kind of way or a table. basically i want u to fully plan this and what new tables to add and what endpoints are missing or need to be changed on the api. plan new tables to keep in mind that every thing is to be documented including who served what or made or yk that type of stuff.
